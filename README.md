## Features

CapOS is an lightweight open source server operating system derived from OpenWrt. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use Linux server experience for beginners. CapOS makes full use of the advantages of OpenWrt such as the LuCI web interface to develop into a fully functional server OS.

Some key highlights of CapOS:

* **Highly Lightweight**: CapOS is built from OpenWrt, an embedded operating system based on Linux. It has a small footprint that can run on various hardware from routers to PCs. The lightweight design allows CapOS to run smoothly even on devices with limited resources.

* **Friendly Web UI**: CapOS provides an simple but powerful web-based interface LuCI for easy server management. Users can easily manage system settings, monitor resources and install packages through the web UI without much Linux knowledge.  

* **Highly Extensible**: Although lightweight, CapOS is highly extensible. Users can install and run many server applications and packages on demand based on their needs. CapOS aims to strike a balance between being lightweight and practical.

* **Easy to Learn**: CapOS has a clean command line interface with standardized Linux commands to simplify operation. The automated and simplified CLI allows beginners to easily get started with CapOS.

* **Stable and Secure**: CapOS is developed based on OpenWrt, a secure and stable Linux system, with the latest kernel and software packages to ensure maximum security and stability.  

* **Runs on Various Hardware**: CapOS can run on popular hardware from routers, PCs to virtual machines. The lightweight design makes it possible to operate CapOS even on resource-constrained devices.  

* **Open Source**: CapOS is released under the GPL license. The open source community is welcome to contribute to make CapOS even more lightweight, extendable and user-friendly.

CapOS aims to provide beginners with an easy-to-use yet practical Linux server OS for learning and practice. The simplified web UI and CLI makes it easy to get started with CapOS. If you are looking for a lightweight but extensible Linux server solution, try CapOS! CapOS is open and free for all. Your feedback and suggestions will help us improve CapOS.

## Download

Generally speaking, the server of the FWERKOR team will automatically obtain the source code from Github and compile it every once in a while. The compiled version will be available for viewing and downloading in *FR-REPO*.

通常来说，FWERKOR团队的服务器会每隔一段时间自动从Github获取源代码并进行编译，编译完成后的版本将可以在*FR-REPO*查看并下载。

* [FR-REPO](https://repo.fwerkor.com/)



## 

The compiled version we provide may not include support for the user's hardware architecture, so users with relevant professional knowledge can compile CapOS by themselves. 

For everything else than simple firmware download, You can refer to some official documentation provided by OpenWrt:

* [OpenWrt Wiki Download](https://openwrt.org/downloads)

## Development

To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a
case sensitive file system.

### Requirements

You need the following tools to compile CapOS, the package names vary between distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages can be found in OpenWrt's [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)
documentation.

```
binutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev
make4.1+ perl python3.7+ rsync subversion unzip which
```

### Quickstart

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the
   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the
   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen
   applications for your target system.
