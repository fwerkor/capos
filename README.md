## Features

CapOS is an lightweight open source server operating system derived from OpenWrt. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use Linux server experience for beginners. CapOS makes full use of the advantages of OpenWrt such as the LuCI web interface to develop into a fully functional server OS.

Some key highlights of CapOS:

* **Highly Lightweight**: CapOS is built from OpenWrt, an embedded operating system based on Linux. It has a small footprint that can run on various hardware from routers to PCs. The lightweight design allows CapOS to run smoothly even on devices with limited resources.

* **Friendly Web UI**: CapOS provides an simple but powerful web-based interface LuCI for easy server management. Users can easily manage system settings, monitor resources and install packages through the web UI without much Linux knowledge.  

* **Highly Extensible**: Although lightweight, CapOS is highly extensible. Users can install and run many server applications and packages on demand based on their needs. CapOS aims to strike a balance between being lightweight and practical.

* **Easy to Learn**: CapOS has a clean command line interface with standardized Linux commands to simplify operation. The automated and simplified CLI allows beginners to easily get started with CapOS.

* **Stable and Secure**: CapOS is developed based on OpenWrt, a secure and stable Linux system, with the latest kernel and software packages to ensure maximum security and stability.  

* **Runs on Various Hardware**: CapOS can run on popular hardware from routers, PCs to virtual machines. The lightweight design makes it possible to operate CapOS even on resource-constrained devices.  

* **Open Source**: CapOS is released under the GPL license. The open source community is welcome to contribute to make CapOS even more lightweight, extendable and user-friendly.

CapOS aims to provide beginners with an easy-to-use yet practical Linux server OS for learning and practice. The simplified web UI and CLI makes it easy to get started with CapOS. If you are looking for a lightweight but extensible Linux server solution, try CapOS! CapOS is open and free for all. Your feedback and suggestions will help us improve CapOS.

## Download

Generally speaking, the server of the FWERKOR team will automatically obtain the source code from Github and compile it every once in a while. The compiled version will be available for viewing and downloading in *FR-REPO*

通常来说，FWERKOR团队的服务器会每隔一段时间自动从Github获取源代码并进行编译，编译完成后的版本将可以在*FR-REPO*查看并下载

## 

An advanced user may require additional or specific package. (Toolchain, SDK, ...) For everything else than simple firmware download, try the wiki download page:

* [OpenWrt Wiki Download](https://openwrt.org/downloads)

## Development

To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a
case sensitive file system.

### Requirements

You need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between
distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in
the [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)
documentation.

```
binutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev
make4.1+ perl python3.7+ rsync subversion unzip which
```

### Quickstart

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the
   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the
   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen
   applications for your target system.

### Related Repositories

The main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of
different categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package
manager called `opkg`. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port
packages to OpenWrt, please find the fitting repository below.

* [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/openwrt/luci): Modern and modular
  interface to control the device via a web browser.

* [OpenWrt Packages](https://github.com/openwrt/packages): Community repository
  of ported packages.
