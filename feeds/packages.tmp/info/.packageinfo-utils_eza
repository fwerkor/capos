Description:  eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable
 file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix
 and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and
 better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types
 and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes,
 and Git.

 And it's small, fast, and just one single binary.
