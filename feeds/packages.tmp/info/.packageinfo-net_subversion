Description:     Subversion is a free/open-source version control system. That is,
  Subversion manages files and directories, and the changes made to them,
  over time. This allows you to recover older versions of your data, or
  examine the history of how your data changed. In this regard, many
  people think of a version control system as a sort of time machine.
  This package contains the Subversion libraries.
