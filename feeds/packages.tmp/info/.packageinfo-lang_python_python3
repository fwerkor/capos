Description: Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
usable as an extension language for applications that need a
programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

This package contains only core Python library.

Description: Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
usable as an extension language for applications that need a
programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

This package contains files for building Python modules, extending the
Python interpreter, or embedded Python in applications.

functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
usable as an extension language for applications that need a
programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
