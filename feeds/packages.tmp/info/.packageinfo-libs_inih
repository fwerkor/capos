Title: Simple .INI file parser in C
Maintainer: Tianling Shen <cnsztl@immortalwrt.org>

Type: ipkg
Description:   inih (INI Not Invented Here) is a simple .INI file parser written
  in C. It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to
  be small and simple, so it's good for embedded systems. It's also
  more or less compatible with Python's ConfigParser style of .INI
  files, including RFC 822-style multi-line syntax and name: value
  entries.
