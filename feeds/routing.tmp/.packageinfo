Description:  Ahcpd is a daemon for configuring an IPv6 network using the Ad-Hoc
 Configuration Protocol (AHCP).  AHCP is designed for wireless mesh
 networks, where IPv6 autoconfiguration and DHCPv6 do not work, but may
 also be used on wired networks.

Description:   alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information
  over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything
  which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv
  visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration
  information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...

  alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert
  information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special
  programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes
  care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other
  nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any
  configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
  information available from all alfred servers in the network.

  with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas in DSDV, AODV and
  Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in wired networks but
  also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended with support for
  overlay networks. Babel is an IETF standard protocol (RFC 8966).

Description: BIRD is an internet routing daemon which manages TCP/IP routing tables
with support of modern routing protocols, easy to use configuration
interface and powerful route filtering language. It is lightweight and
efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers.


BIRD supports OSPFv2, RIPv2, Babel and BGP protocols for IPv4 and
OSPFv3, RIPng, Babel and BGP protocols for IPv6.

In BGP, BIRD supports communities, multiprotocol extensions, MD5
authentication, 32bit AS numbers and could act as a route server or a
route reflector. BIRD also supports multiple RIBs, multiple kernel
routing tables and redistribution between the protocols with a powerful
configuration syntax.

This is the 2.0 branch of Bird which integrates support for IPv4 and IPv6
into a single branch, and also adds support for the Babel routing protocol.

Source: mesh11sd-5.1.3.tar.gz
License: GPL-2.0-or-later
LicenseFiles: LICENSE
URL: https://github.com/opennds/mesh11sd
Type: ipkg
Description:   Mesh11sd is a package that autonomously configures and manages all aspects of an 802.11s mesh network and its connected nodes.
  The package acts as a service daemon, dynamically setting mesh parameters across all nodes.
  It is particularly useful for simplifying setup, reducing manual configuration, and improving network reliability.
  Support for point to multi-point vxlan tunneling over the wireless backhaul is included as standard.
  A guest/iot type network is auto-configured without requiring complex vlan setup.
  If required, custom vlan trunking over the vxlan tunnel is supported.
  Mesh-gate access point usage is collected in a central database on the mesh portal.
  A command line interface is provided for reporting in json format output.
  An optional Customer/Client Premises Equipment (CPE) mode, greatly simplifies rollout of community WISP projects.

  PCP (Port Control Protocol - RFC6887) requests requests to PCP remote servers.

  In and of itself, it is not very useful, but combined with hnetd+miniupnpd
  it allows for control of NAT forwarding and firewall pinholes from multiple
  hops away.

Description: Reboots or triggers watchdog if no link-local neighbor is available.

Important:
Be careful when you do a sysupgrade. Stop naywatch first, and make
sure procd took control again of the watchdog.
You can do this using 'ubus call system watchdog'.  Status should be "running".

License: GPL-3.0-or-later
URL: http://www.priv.nu/projects/ndppd/
Type: ipkg
Description:  ndppd, or NDP Proxy Daemon, is a daemon that proxies NDP (Neighbor Discovery
 Protocol) messages between interfaces.  ndppd currently only supports Neighbor
 Solicitation Messages and Neighbor Advertisement Messages.

 The ndp_proxy provided by Linux doesn't support listing proxies, and only hosts
 are supported.  No subnets.  ndppd solves this by listening for Neighbor
 Solicitation messages on an interface, then query the internal interfaces for
 that target IP before finally sending a Neighbor Advertisement message.

Description:   openNDS (open Network Demarcation Service) is a high performance, small footprint, Captive Portal.
  It provides a border control gateway between a public local area network and the Internet.
  It supports all scenarios ranging from small stand alone venues through to large mesh networks with multiple portal entry points.
  Both the client driven Captive Portal Detection method (CPD) and gateway driven Captive Portal Identification method (CPI - RFC 8910 and RFC 8908) are supported.
  This version uses nftables.

Type: ipkg
Description:   Prince is an open source implementation of the PopRouting Algorithm.
  It has been developed as a Google Summer of Code Project in collaboration with Freifunk and the University of Trento.

  Prince fetches topology data from a Link State routing daemon (OONF, OLSR, OSPF, etc),
  calculates the betweenness centrality using the topology and then computes the
  the timers' optimal values using these data. At the end of the computation the timers are pushed back to the routing daemon.
  Since v0.4 it supports both OONF and OLSRd.
